## Data Structure Definition

### Task Data Structure
```
Task {
    id: string (unique identifier)
    title: string (task name/species name)
    description: string (evolutionary features)
    priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' (survival priority)
    environment: 'competitive' | 'collaborative' | 'adaptive' (evolution environment)
    adaptationScore: number (0-100) (adaptation score)
    deadline: string (ISO date) (adaptation deadline)
    status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'eliminated' (status)
    generation: number (evolution generation)
    mutations: array of strings (mutation history)
    fitnessScore: number (0-100) (fitness level)
    createdAt: string (ISO date)
    updatedAt: string (ISO date)
}
```

### Evolution Statistics Data
```
