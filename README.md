## 🧪 Evolution Algorithm

### Natural Selection Process
```javascript
// Survival probability calculation
const survivalProbability = (
  adaptationScore * 0.4 +
  environmentFit * 0.3 +
  timeToDeadline * 0.2 +
  priorityWeight * 0.1
);
```

### Mutation Mechanisms
- **Strategic Mutations**: `strategy-pivot`, `market-expansion`, `innovation-leap`
- **Tactical Mutations**: `tactical-enhancement`, `resource-optimization`, `efficiency-boost`
- **Adaptation Effects**: ±10 point fitness variations maintain diversity

### Environmental Adaptation
- **Competitive Pressure**: Priority survival for high-performance tasks
- **Collaborative Opportunities**: Fitness improvement through mutual complementarity
- **Innovation Demand**: Preference for tasks with novel characteristics
